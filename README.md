# HTMLAssessment
## This project is a simple webpage that serves as a showcase for the fundamental skills we have gained during our intro to HTML coding. 

# Project Description
## To showcase the skills we have gained during SKill Distiller's introductory lesson to HTML and HTML coding, we created a webpage with four major sections:
### - Text
### - Table
### - List
### - Form
## Altogether, these four sections display the following skills:
### - The ability to use HTML tags to format web content, including paragraphs, tabular material, and media.
### - The proper use or ordered and unordered lists.
### - The integration of lorem ipsum text as a feature of mock-up design.
### - The use of forms to elicit information from a user.

# Technologies Used
## HTML
### As part of Skill Distillery's Full Stack Development course, we are currently focusing just on HTML. This will lay a foundation for creating front-end user interfaces capable of interacting with back-end architecture.

# Lessons Learned
## The primary *skills* learned were basic HTML. While I already knew about the majority of this functionality and how to implement it, this exercise served as a good refresher. The new content I learned was how to format tables internally in a way that produced a more polished result.
## The major lesson I took from this exrercise is the importance of a good user interface. Having dipped my toe in these waters, I will be able to situate follow-on lessons in the context of how they can help me create beautiful, intuitive, and functional user interfaces that not only serve a given end but make users actively enjoy the experience and want to spend time in the app.
